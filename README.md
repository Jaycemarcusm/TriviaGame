# Trivia Game (Python Project)
##### _**(this readme is written as if this project were to be publicly accessible)**_

This is my submission for the Python Security course final at Jackson College. 
This code executes a basic trivia game utilizing tkinter to offer a simple GUI functionality.

This README assumes you are executing the code and running Python from a Windows machine. 

- If you are operating on Linux, but don't know how to install Python, I wholeheartedly do not know what to tell you.

## Things we'll need:

|    Python     | [[Download]](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - I promise it's not a virus. |
| ttkbootstrap  |               *See below* **_AFTER_** you've installed Python.                |
|   Good Luck   |      I have no idea. Let me know if you find out. No, seriously, please.      |


### Installing ttkbootstrap

1. Open CMD 
   - You can do this by navigating to your desktop, followed by typing "cmd.exe" (***without** the quotes for the love of god*) in your windows search bar in the bottom left (or wherever you have your Windows button) and hitting enter.
      - You'll see a spooky black box appear that's gonna make you feel like you should be sipping mountain dew and "hacking into mainframes." 
      - Everybody is allowed one chance to say, "I'm in.", but that's it. **One.** 
2. Type:
   - >```pip install ttkbootstrap```
     - hit enter
5. Done!
   - If it failed, you'll need to do some troubleshooting regarding your python installation. I recommend YouTube, Reddit, StackOverflow, or just restarting your PC. 
     - **I'm not joking. Restart your PC.** I'll wait. *I pinky promise.*

#### Have Fun!

I added functionality for creating your own questions, so feel free to try that out! Maybe make your own super long quiz! You will need to restart the quiz to see the new questions, so keep that in mind.

I didn't get a chance to add a delete function for unwanted questions, but that's currently my next step. 

I'd also like to add highscores, a main menu for deeper customization, better UI presentation, and API interaction for dynamic question lists based on category, genre, and difficulty. I had hoped to accomplish the API integration with this project, but most API I came across needed to be built around and required heavy modifications of the code, unfortunately.
